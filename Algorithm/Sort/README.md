[Sorting Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)
====
There are a lot of sorting algorithms, I have only done on a part of the exercises and tests, and there are a lot of tests that are not tested because of their time complexity (e.g. bogo sort) or implementation complexity (e.g. tim sort). Here are some of the tests I did:
* Comparison sorts
  * binary_tree_sort
  * bubble_sort
  * comb_sort
  * heap_sort
  * insertion_sort
  * merge_sort
  * odd_even_sort
  * quick_sort
  * selection_sort
  * shell_sort
  * smooth_sort
* Non-comparison sorts
  * bucket_sort
  * counting_sort
  * radix_sort
* other
  * sleep_sort
